# **ENI6MA**

**The Only Password You Will Never Use.**

Eni6ma is reinventing identity for a secure world. Today‚Äôs authentication methods‚Äîpasswords, MFA, passkeys, and biometrics‚Äîare either insecure, inconvenient, or both. Eni6ma eliminates static credentials entirely with a breakthrough system that fully secures all passwords, enables safe login in public, and resists phishing, replay, and brute-force attacks. Both post-quantum and AI-safe, our first-in-class technology is redefining personal privacy. Backed by a world-class team and a filed patent, Eni6ma is partnering with leaders in crypto, fintech, and defense. Now raising $3‚Äì5M in an unpriced pre-seed SAFE note to redefine digital identity and security. Forget passwordless 2FA, MFA, and biometrics‚Äîthey‚Äôre outdated and vulnerable. Eni6ma delivers next generation, post-quantum, AI-safe authentication with secure voice login anywhere.

## **üîê The Problem**

Traditional authentication methods are broken:

* Passwords are easily stolen, reused, or forgotten.

* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds friction, is vulnerable to phishing and SIM swaps, and ties security to specific devices.

* Passkeys (2FA)  requires expensive network connected hardware that can be lost or stolen.

* Biometrics, once compromised, can't be changed‚Äîand raise serious privacy concerns.

## **üìâ The Impact**

* **80%** of cyberattacks involve compromised passwords

* **$4.25M**: Average cost of a data breach

* **94%** of people worldwide use passwords

* **57%** forget passwords due to frequent changes

* **54%** dislike MFA

* **52%** keep passwords on sticky notes

* **34%** rely on password managers‚Äîyet breaches still happen

* **63%** reuse old passwords

* **20%** of passwords worldwide have already been breached

* **$10 Trillion USD**: Projected global losses from data breaches by 2025

## **üß† The ENI6MA Solution**

**ENI6MA introduces a patent-pending 2KP (Two-Factor Zero Knowledge Proof) authentication protocol** engineered for digital wallets, ATMs, enterprise systems, mobile phones, and websites. It redefines digital identity by replacing static credentials with unphishable, human-interactive, and secure mechanisms.

### **Key Benefits:**

* **Passwordless \+ Replay-Proof**: Users never enter the same credentials twice‚Äîeliminating replay attacks.

* **Voice Authentication, Anywhere**: First to enable secure voice-based login in public spaces.

* **Unphishable & Unbreakable**: Resistant to phishing, eavesdropping, SIM swaps, and brute-force attacks.

* **User-Centric**: Maximum security with minimal friction.

* **Even Protects on Compromised Devices**
