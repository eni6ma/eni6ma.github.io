# Consequences of Non-Compliance with Mandatory Cyber-Security 

The modern cyber-regulatory landscape has evolved into a dense lattice of overlapping statutes, sectoral rules, and voluntary-but-effectively-mandatory assurance frameworks. Whether an organisation is a multinational bank, a SaaS start-up, or an energy utility, a material data breach now triggers investigations by a half-dozen authorities at once, each empowered to levy its own fines and impose its own remediation timetable. The result is an enforcement environment in which a single control failure reverberates far beyond the direct costs of containment and forensics: regulatory penalties alone now routinely surpass eight figures, while non-monetary sanctions—ranging from certificate withdrawal to loss of market access—can constrain revenue for years after the incident is closed.

Against this backdrop, global “baseline” standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, PCI-DSS 4.0, and SOC 2 Type II have become table stakes for market entry. Although technically voluntary, they function as de facto licences to operate: failure to pass an ISO surveillance audit can disqualify a bidder from public tenders; an un-remediated PCI gap can see card-processing privileges revoked overnight, and a qualified SOC 2 opinion is enough to stall enterprise sales pipelines. Monetary exposure at this tier is comparatively modest—tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for re-certification, fines, and forensic audits—but the collateral commercial damage is severe: higher cyber-insurance premiums, cancelled contracts, and permanent reputational scars.

In the United States the “soft” standards are overlaid by a patchwork of compulsory federal and state regimes whose penalties scale with industry criticality. A bank that flouts OCC safety-and-soundness expectations, GLBA safeguards, or New York’s DFS Part 500 can realistically expect US \\$ 70 - 75 million in civil money penalties for a single incident, while broker-dealers and listed companies face SEC and SOX fines that add several million more. Non-bank financial institutions—fintech lenders, credit bureaus, asset managers—escape the OCC tariff only to confront FTC settlements that now average US \\$ 7-8 million, plus CCPA/CPRA exposure of roughly US \\$ 1 million and PCI brand assessments of about US \\$ 25 000. For mainstream, non-financial companies the regulatory bill is smaller but still punishing: the typical breach today triggers an FTC “unfair practices” order (~US \\$ 5 million), a multistate attorney-general settlement (~US \\$ 10 million), and, if Californian data are involved, another US \\$ 1.2 million under the CPRA—placing the blended regulatory hit for one incident in the US \\$ 16-22 million range before class actions or incident-response costs.

**Europe raises the stakes further through harmonised, turnover-based fines**. The GDPR’s ceiling of 4 percent of global sales (or €20 million) has been well publicised, but newer instruments such as NIS 2 and DORA extend that model into cyber-resilience and financial-sector ICT risk. NIS 2’s 2 percent revenue penalty is paired with personal liability and temporary management bans, while DORA subjects banks, insurers, and their ICT providers to daily fines of 1 percent of average turnover until deficiencies are fixed. In parallel, eIDAS and the EU Cyber-Security Act act as market gatekeepers: losing qualified-trust-service status or failing to achieve a “High” assurance certificate can instantly shut a vendor out of pan-European public procurement.

Outside the trans-Atlantic corridor, jurisdictions are converging on the same enforcement philosophy—high headline fines plus stiff non-monetary remedies. Brazil’s LGPD allows penalties up to 2 percent of domestic revenue (capped at R\\$ 50 million), China’s PIPL pairs 5 percent turnover fines with executive blacklisting, and Australia now threatens A\\$ 50 million or 30 percent of ill-gotten benefit for serious violations. Even traditionally lighter-touch regimes are tightening: Canada’s Bill C-27 will add C\\$ 10 million fines to PIPEDA, and India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act sets a ₹250 crore (~US \\$ 30 million) maximum per breach. Across the Middle East and Africa the pattern repeats—Saudi Arabia’s PDPL imposes SAR 5 million penalties and potential imprisonment, while South Africa’s POPIA layers criminal sanctions atop administrative fines.

Taken together, these trends signal a decisive shift from “check-box” compliance to continuous, evidence-driven assurance. Boards must allocate capital not only for technology controls but also for the audit machinery—control libraries, automated evidence capture, scenario testing—that lets a firm demonstrate compliance to ten regulators at once. Cyber-insurance and contractual indemnities may soften the first financial blow, yet they rarely address the strategic costs of losing a FedRAMP authorisation, an ISO certificate, or a place on the EU Trust List. The lesson for risk officers is clear: invest up-front in integrated governance that maps each control to every applicable statute, because when a breach arrives the bill will be measured not merely in dollars paid but in markets forfeited, licences withdrawn, and trust—once lost—painful to regain.

##  **United States Regulatory Consequences**

In the United States, the regulatory stakes for cyber-security non-compliance differ sharply between financial entities and the broader commercial sector, yet both cohorts now face a multilayered gauntlet of federal and state authorities. For OCC-, Fed-, or FDIC-supervised banks, a single breach typically summons the banking agencies under safety-and-soundness powers as well as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) safeguards. Recent consent orders show civil-money penalties clustering around US \\$ 70 million per incident, with regulators simultaneously imposing comprehensive remediation plans, third-party monitors, and—increasingly—individual accountability for directors and senior executives. Broker-dealers, investment advisers, and listed companies build additional exposure: SEC actions under Regulation S-P, the new cyber-incident-disclosure rules, and Sarbanes-Oxley §404(b) routinely add another US \\$ 2–5 million in fines plus the threat of securities-fraud litigation if disclosures are deemed misleading. Layer on New York’s DFS Part 500 for any institution licensed in that state (≈US \\$ 1 million per investigation) and PCI-DSS assessments for compromised card data, and a regulated bank can easily see its regulatory bill crest US \\$ 75 million—before counting class actions, customer restitution, or incident-response costs.

Non-bank financial institutions—fintech lenders, credit bureaus, mortgage servicers—escape the OCC tariff but land squarely in the FTC’s cross-hairs. The updated GLBA Safeguards Rule gives the Commission uncapped fining authority, and recent settlements (e.g., BetterHelp, 2023) place the “middle of the envelope” around US \\$ 7–8 million per breach. These figures rise rapidly when the same incident triggers SEC penalties for public issuers, New York DFS fines, and California’s Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) penalties of roughly US \\$ 1.2 million. On a blended basis, a medium-sized non-bank financial firm now budgets about US \\$ 12 million in regulatory exposure for a material event—an amount that may double if the breach reveals willful misstatements, repeat violations, or inadequate board oversight.

For companies outside the financial vertical, the enforcement constellation shifts but remains punitive. The Federal Trade Commission wields Section 5 of the FTC Act against “unfair or deceptive” security practices, averaging roughly US \\$ 5 million per action since 2022 and frequently attaching 20-year consent decrees that mandate annual audits and board-level certification. Parallel multistate attorney-general settlements have emerged as the most expensive state-level sanction, with coordinated investigations settling for about US \\$ 10 million, while the CPRA adds a California-specific fine and opens the door to statutory-damage class actions that can eclipse the public-law penalties. Public companies incur an extra SEC overlay—Regulation S-P and the new Form 8-K Item 1.05 cyber-disclosure rule—adding roughly US \\$ 2 million in civil penalties and exposing executives to securities-fraud liability if incident details are withheld or misstated.

Beyond the dollar figures lie non-monetary sanctions that frequently outlast the checks written to Washington or Sacramento. Federal agencies can revoke a bank’s authority-to-operate, the FBI can terminate CJIS data access, and the FedRAMP Program Management Office can expel a cloud provider from the federal marketplace—actions that sever revenue streams overnight. At the state level, New York DFS has begun conditioning licences on personal executive attestations, while the CPRA’s rule-making board is shortening cure periods and experimenting with algorithmic disgorgement remedies. Combined with rising cyber-insurance retentions and customers’ contractual indemnity clauses, the American compliance calculus now pairs eight-figure monetary fines with existential operational risks, making proactive, evidence-driven governance the cheapest option left on the table.

## **USA FINANCIAL OrGS Exposure**

### *Typical Monetary Exposure for a U.S.-based Financial-Services Firm After ONE Cyber-Security Failure*   **(figures reflect the mid-range of recent enforcement, not the statutory maximums)**

| Regime (all compulsory) | “Average” Civil Penalty Seen 2022-25* | Illustrative Enforcement Example | How It Hits a Single Firm |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **OCC / Federal banking regulators – safety-&-soundness + GLBA §501(b) guidelines** | **≈ US \\$ 70 million** | Citibank CMP \\$ 75 M (Oct 2024) (occ.gov); City National Bank CMP \\$ 65 M (Jan 2024) (occ.gov) | Applies if the company is a nationally-chartered or FDIC/Fed-supervised bank; penalty is imposed once per enforcement action arising from an incident. |
| **SEC Reg S-P / SOX 404(b) (cyber-controls & disclosure)** | **≈ US \\$ 2 million** | R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. – \\$ 2.1 M (Jun 2024) (sec.gov) | Any public issuer, broker-dealer or investment adviser is exposed. |
| **NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500 (if licensed in NY)** | **≈ US \\$ 1 million** | First American Title Ins. – \\$ 1 M (Nov 2023) (dfs.ny.gov) | One penalty per investigation; larger breaches have reached US \\$ 4–5 M. |
| **FTC GLBA Safeguards Rule (covers non-bank FIs)** | **≈ US \\$ 7.8 million** | BetterHelp settlement \\$ 7.8 M (Jul 2023) (ftc.gov) | Mutually exclusive with OCC banking fines—applies to lenders, fintechs, credit bureaus, etc. |
| **PCI-DSS (card-brand assessments)** | **≈ US \\$ 25,000** | Typical brand assessment range US \\$ 5 K-50 K (sprinto.com) | Levied by Visa/Mastercard per breach, billed via the acquiring bank. |
| **California CCPA/CPRA (if Calif. data affected)** | **≈ US \\$ 1.2 million** | Sephora CCPA settlement \\$ 1.2 M (Aug 2022) (oag.ca.gov) | Civil penalty from CA AG or CPPA; private-action damages add further exposure. |

### ***“Average” = midpoint of published consent-order amounts for cyber-security/control failures since 2022; figures exclude outlier mega-settlements and private class-action payouts.**

### 

| Scenario | OCC / FTC | SEC | NYDFS | PCI | CCPA | Blended Total |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Regulated bank or credit-union (OCC-supervised)** | 70 M | 2 M | 1 M | 0.025 M | 1.2 M | **≈ US \\$ 74.3 million per incident** |
| **Non-bank financial institution (FTC-regulated)** | 7.8 M | 2 M | 1 M | 0.025 M | 1.2 M | **≈ US \\$ 12.1 million per incident** |

### **What the “single-incident” total really means**

* ###  Single investigation, multiple dockets: Regulators usually coordinate, so each agency issues one penalty order covering every control breakdown revealed by the incident. 

* ### Civil only: Criminal exposure (e.g., willful SEC misstatements) and private class actions (CCPA statutory damages, securities litigation) sit on top of the figures above.

* ### Escalators: Repeat offences, willful misconduct, consumer-impact scale, and refusal to remediate quickly can lift the OCC/SEC/NYDFS numbers well beyond the mid-range shown.

### For budgeting and risk-transfer purposes, a U.S. financial-services firm should therefore assume baseline regulatory fines ± US \\$ 10 million in the non-bank case and ± US \\$ 25 million in the bank case, before counting litigation, customer restitution, and incident-response costs.

## **USA NON-FINANCIAL ORGS Exposure**

**Regulatory-fine “ballpark” for a single U.S. company outside the financial-services sector that suffers one material cyber incident**  
 (Figures are mid-range consent-order amounts from 2022-Q1 2025—i.e., neither minimum statutory penalties nor headline-making outliers such as Equifax \\$ 575 M. They exclude class-action settlements, incident-response costs, and lost business.)

| Compulsory Regime (typical trigger) | Governing Authority | Avg. Civil \\$ \\$  Penalty per Incident | Enforcement Examples 2022-25 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| FTC Act §5 – “unfair / deceptive” data-security practices | Federal Trade Commission | ≈ US \\$  5 million | BetterHelp \\$ 7.8 M (2023), CafePress \\$ 0.5 M (2022), Drizzly \\$ 0 (injunctive) |
| Multistate AG data-breach settlements (all 50 states + DC have breach-notification laws) | Coalition of State Attorneys-General (lead state negotiates) | ≈ US \\$  10 million | Home Depot \\$ 17.5 M (2020), T-Mobile \\$ 2.5 M/ state cap (2023) |
| California CCPA / CPRA (if Californians affected) | California Privacy Protection Agency & CA Attorney-General | ≈ US \\$  1.2 million | Sephora \\$ 1.2 M (2022), DoorDash draft notice \\$ 0.375 M (2024) |
| PCI-DSS brand assessments (if card data compromised) | Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover via acquiring banks | ≈ US \\$  25,000 | Breach assessments typically US \\$ 5 k–50 k; separate card re-issuance fees can triple this |
| SOX §404 / SEC cyber-disclosure rules (public issuers only) | U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission | ≈ US \\$  2 million | R.R. Donnelley \\$ 2.1 M (2024), SolarWinds action pending but guidance range 1–3 M |
| HIPAA Privacy & Security Rules (healthcare & business associates only) | HHS Office for Civil Rights | ≈ US \\$  4 million | Anthem MA \\$ 8.7 M (2022 OCR split), Aveanna \\$ 1 M (2023) |

### **Exposure Totals (one incident, one company)**

| Scenario | FTC §5 | State AGs | CCPA | PCI | SEC / SOX | HIPAA | Blended Total |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Public, non-health-care company | 5 M | 10 M | 1.2 M | 0.025 M | 2 M | — | ≈ US \\$  18.225 million |
| Private (non-public) company | 5 M | 10 M | 1.2 M | 0.025 M | — | — | ≈ US \\$  16.225 million |
| Healthcare provider / HIPAA BA (public or private) | 5 M | 10 M | 1.2 M | 0.025 M | — / +2 M if public | 4 M | ≈ US \\$  20.2 million (private) – 22.2 million (public) |

#### **Reading the numbers**

* **One regulator, one check.** Each agency generally issues one civil penalty order stemming from the incident, even if multiple rule clauses were violated.

* **Stackable fines.** Nothing bars these penalties from accumulating; they come from different statutes and authorities.

* **Criminal and civil litigation sit on top.** DOJ indictments (for willful deception) and consumer class actions (CCPA statutory damages, securities suits) can easily double or triple the total.

* **Escalators.** Larger customer counts, children’s data, or evidence of concealment can push individual line-items to statutory maxima (e.g., FTC can seek US \\$  50 000 per COPPA-affected child; HIPAA tops at US \\$  2 M per category per year).

For enterprise risk planning, a mainstream U.S. company that is not a bank or broker-dealer should budget ≈ US \\$ 15-25 million in regulatory exposure per significant breach, assuming “average” enforcement rather than record-setting cases.
