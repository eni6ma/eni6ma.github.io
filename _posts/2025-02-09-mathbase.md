## Axioms and Lemmas

### Axioms

**Axiom of Initialization**: The protocol $$Π$$ commences with a predefined sequence $$P$$, comprised of elements $$p_1$$ to $$p_n$$, and a static alphabet $$A$$. For each verification round $$R$$, the shuffling function $$Σ$$ generates a fresh and unpredictable shuffled version of $$A$$, denoted as $$X^R$$. This axiom ensures that the protocol begins with a consistent sequence and introduces variability through shuffled alphabets in each round.

* **Equation**: $$P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}$$, $$X^R = Σ(A)$$ for $$R = 1, 2, ..., n$$.
* **Expression**: This axiom establishes the protocol $$Π$$ begins with a predefined sequence $$P$$, consisting of elements $$p_1$$ to $$p_n$$, and a static alphabet $$A$$. For each verification round $$R$$, a shuffled version of $$A$$, denoted as $$X^R$$, is produced through the shuffling function $$Σ$$, ensuring fresh and unpredictable challenges in each round.

**Axiom of Random Distribution**: Each round $$R$$ of the protocol $$Π$$ produces a distinct shuffled alphabet $$X^R$$ from the static alphabet $$A$$ via the shuffling function $$Σ$$. The axiom asserts that for differing rounds $$R$$ and $$R'$$, the shuffled alphabets $$X^R$$ and $$X^{R'}$$ are distinct ($$X^R \neq X^{R'}$$). This condition ensures the unpredictability and non-repetitive nature of the challenges encountered in successive rounds, vital for enhancing the security of the verification process.

* **Equation**: $$X^R = Σ(A)$$, ensuring $$X^R \neq X^{R'}$$ for $$R \neq R'$$.
* **Expression**: This asserts that each round $$R$$ of the protocol generates a uniquely shuffled alphabet $$X^R$$ from $$A$$, via $$Σ$$. The condition $$X^R \neq X^{R'}$$ for differing rounds ensures that the sequence of challenges is non-repetitive and unpredictable, fundamental for securing the verification process.

**Axiom of Sequence Verification**: For every element $$p_i$$ within the sequence $$P$$, there exists a designated subset $$x_i^R$$ within the shuffled alphabet $$X^R$$ where $$p_i$$ can be located and verified. This axiom emphasizes the protocol's capability to identify and authenticate individual elements of the sequence, ensuring the integrity of the verification process.

* **Equation**: Existence of $$x_i^R$$ such that $$p_i \in x_i^R$$ for each $$p_i$$ in $$P$$.
* **Expression**: For every element $$p_i$$ within the sequence $$P$$, there exists a targeted subset $$x_i^R$$ within the shuffled alphabet $$X^R$$ where $$p_i$$ can be found and verified. This axiom underscores the protocol's capacity to pinpoint and verify individual sequence elements.

**Axiom of Completeness**: The axiom asserts that for all elements $$p_i$$ within the sequence $$P$$, there exists at least one subset $$x_i^R$$ within the shuffled alphabet $$X^R$$ where the verification condition $$Μ$$ returns true ($$Μ(p_i, x_i^R) = \text{true}$$). This ensures comprehensive verification of every element of $$P$$ throughout the execution of the protocol, reinforcing its reliability and completeness.

* **Equation**: $$\forall p_i \in P, \exists x_i^R \in X^R : Μ(p_i, x_i^R) = \text{true}$$.
* **Expression**: Signifies that for all elements $$p_i$$ within $$P$$, there must be a subset $$x_i^R$$ in $$X^R$$ for which the verification condition $$Μ$$ returns true, ensuring every element of $$P$$ is verified throughout the protocol's execution.

**Axiom of Non-collision**: This axiom guarantees the uniqueness of the generated shuffled alphabets $$X^R$$ and their corresponding subsets $$x_i^R$$ across different rounds. It ensures that no collisions occur in the generation process, maintaining the integrity of the verification process by preventing identical shuffles or subsets from appearing in multiple rounds.

* **Equation**: Unique generation of $$X^R$$ and $$x_i^R$$, preventing collisions.
* **Expression**: Guarantees that the generation process for $$X^R$$ and its subsets $$x_i^R$$ produces unique configurations, ensuring the integrity of the verification process by avoiding identical shuffles or subsets across different rounds.

### Lemmas

**Lemma of Witness Validity**: This lemma asserts that if the witness function $$Ω$$ correctly identifies the subset $$x_i^R$$ for an element $$p_i$$ and the subsequent verification $$Μ$$ confirms the presence of $$p_i$$ within $$x_i^R$$, then the verification of $$p_i$$ for that specific round is considered valid. Mathematically, it can be expressed as $$Ω(p_i) \rightarrow x_i^R \land Μ(p_i, x_i^R) = \text{true}$$, indicating the conjunction of $$Ω$$ and $$Μ$$ as criteria for valid verification.

* **Equation**: $$Ω(p_i) \rightarrow x_i^R \land Μ(p_i, x_i^R) = \text{true}$$.
* **Expression**: States that if the witness function $$Ω$$ accurately identifies the subset $$x_i^R$$ for an element $$p_i$$, and the verification $$Μ$$ confirms $$p_i$$'s presence in $$x_i^R$$, then $$p_i$$'s verification for that round is deemed valid.

**Lemma of Comprehensive Verification**: This lemma signifies that the sequence $$P$$ achieves full authentication against the shuffled alphabet $$X^R$$ if, for each round $$R$$, the verification condition $$Μ$$ holds true for every $$p_i$$ within its designated subset $$x_i^R$$. Mathematically, it is represented as $$\bigwedge_{R=1}^{n} Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \Rightarrow P \text{ authenticated}$$, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the verification process across all rounds.

* **Equation**: $$\bigwedge_{R=1}^{n} Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \Rightarrow P \text{ authenticated}$$.
* **Expression**: Indicates that the sequence $$P$$ is fully authenticated against the shuffled alphabet $$X^R$$ if, for all rounds $$R$$, the verification condition $$Μ$$ for each $$p_i$$ within its respective subset $$x_i^R$$ holds true.

**Lemma of Accumulative Proof**: In this lemma, the final proof of knowledge $$Κ$$ is validated if the accumulator $$Λ$$, which aggregates all verification outcomes $$Μ$$ across rounds $$R$$, evaluates to true. This lemma encapsulates the protocol's integrity by affirming the authentication of the sequence $$P$$ through cumulative verification success. Mathematically, it is denoted as $$Λ = \bigwedge_{R=1}^{n} Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \Rightarrow Κ = \text{true}$$.

* **Equation**: $$Λ = \bigwedge_{R=1}^{n} Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \Rightarrow Κ = \text{true}$$.
* **Expression**: Explains that the final proof of knowledge $$Κ$$ is validated if the accumulator $$Λ$$, which aggregates all verification outcomes $$Μ$$ across rounds $$R$$, is true. This encapsulates the protocol's integrity by affirming the sequence $$P$$'s authentication through cumulative verification success.

**Lemma of Dynamic Adaptability**: Asserting the protocol's ability to adapt to varying sizes of the sequence $$P$$ and alphabet $$A$$ without compromising integrity, this lemma highlights the scalability and adaptability of $$Π$$. Mathematically, it states the adaptation without loss of $$Π$$ integrity, expressed as $$|P|$$ and $$|A|$$ varying without affecting the protocol's integrity.

* **Equation**: Adaptation to varying $$|P|$$ and $$|A|$$ without loss of $$Π$$ integrity.
* **Expression**: Asserts that the protocol $$Π$$ can flexibly adjust to different sizes of the sequence $$P$$ and alphabet $$A$$ without compromising its verification integrity or security, demonstrating $$Π$$'s scalability and adaptability.

**Lemma of Security Enhancement**: This lemma emphasizes the protocol's enhanced security against cryptographic and brute-force threats due to the unpredictability introduced by the shuffling function $$Σ$$, creating a dynamic and secure verification environment. Mathematically, it states the security enhancement as $$Σ(A) \rightarrow X^R$$, underlining the crucial role of $$Σ$$ in bolstering security measures within the protocol.

* **Equation**: Enhanced security through unpredictability, $$Σ(A) \rightarrow X^R$$.
* **Expression**: Highlights that security against cryptographic and brute-force threats is significantly enhanced by the unpredictability factor introduced through the shuffling function $$Σ$$, creating a dynamic and secure verification environment.

### Constraints

**Constraint of Round Completeness**:

* **Equation**: $$\forall R, Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \text{ must complete}$$.
* **Expression**: This constraint mandates that in every round $$R$$, the verification process $$Μ$$ for each element $$p_i$$ within its designated subset $$x_i^R$$ must be fully executed, ensuring no part of the verification cycle is left incomplete.

**Constraint of Subset Uniqueness**:

* **Equation**: $$x_i^R \neq x_j^{R'}$$ for $$R \neq R'$$ or $$i \neq j$$.
* **Expression**: To maintain the integrity of the verification process, each subset $$x_i^R$$ generated for a round $$R$$ must be unique. This prevents any potential overlap or repetition of subsets across different rounds, reinforcing the security and robustness of $$Π$$.

**Constraint of Proof Consistency**:

* **Equation**: $$Λ = \bigwedge_{R=1}^{n} Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \Rightarrow Κ = \text{true}$$.
* **Expression**: The validation of the proof of knowledge $$Κ$$ hinges on the consistent truth of all verification outcomes $$Μ$$ aggregated in $$Λ$$. This ensures that $$Κ$$ is declared true only if every element $$p_i$$ of $$P$$ is successfully verified across all rounds $$R$$.

**Constraint of Witness Integrity**:

* **Equation**: $$Ω(p_i) \text{ must be verifiable against } P$$.
* **Expression**: The witness $$Ω$$, indicating where an element $$p_i$$ should be found within $$X^R$$, must be reliably linked to the prover's knowledge of the sequence $$P$$. This guards against misleading or incorrect indications that could compromise the verification integrity.

**Constraint of Verification Transparency**:

* **Equation**: $$Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \land Κ \text{ must be externally verifiable}$$.
* **Expression**: The process underscores the necessity for both the verification outcomes $$Μ$$ and the final proof $$Κ$$ to be transparent and amenable to external verification. This openness fosters trust and verifiability in the authentication process implemented by $$Π$$.

### Principles

* **Principle of Sequential Integrity**:
  * **Equation**: Orderly $$Μ(p_i, x_i^R)$$ preserves $$P$$ integrity.
  * **Expression**: The orderly execution of verification $$Μ$$ for elements within $$P$$, following the sequence integrity, ensures the robustness of the authentication process, guaranteeing that each step follows logically from the previous one without breaches in logical continuity.
* **Principle of Protocol Security**:
  * **Equation**: $$Σ(A) \land \bigwedge_{R=1}^{n} Μ(p_i, x_i^R) \land Λ \Rightarrow \text{secure } Π$$.
  * **Expression**: The security of the protocol $$Π$$ is reinforced through the combination of unpredictable shuffling ($$Σ$$), thorough verification ($$Μ$$) across all rounds, and the cumulative confirmation ($$Λ$$) of these verifications, creating a robust defense against unauthorized access and manipulation.
* **Principle of Verifiability**:
  * **Equation**: External verification of $$Μ \land Κ$$.
  * **Expression**: Emphasizes the protocol's capacity for its verification steps and the final proof to be validated by third parties, enhancing the overall credibility and trustworthiness of $$Π$$.
* **Principle of Non-repudiation**:
  * **Equation**: $$Λ$$ documents verification, preventing denial.
  * **Expression**: The documentation and aggregation of verification results in $$Λ$$ serve as a solid foundation for non-repudiation, ensuring that once an authentication claim is made, it cannot be denied or disputed.

### Implications

* **Implication of Continuity**:
  * **Equation**: $$Π$$ mechanism for re-verification or secure termination after failure.
  * **Expression**: This ensures that $$Π$$ includes mechanisms to either allow for the re-verification of elements upon failure or to securely terminate the session, safeguarding the integrity of the process and preventing potential security breaches.
* **Implication of Evolution**:
  * **Equation**: $$Π$$ updates to cryptographic methods without negating past validations.
  * **Expression**: $$Π$$ is designed to be future-proof, permitting updates and enhancements to its cryptographic methodologies without invalidating previously authenticated sequences. This adaptability ensures that $$Π$$ remains relevant and secure in the face of evolving cryptographic landscapes.
