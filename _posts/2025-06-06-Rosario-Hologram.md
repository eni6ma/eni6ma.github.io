The Rosario-Wang architecture implements a holographic morphism model that achieves information-theoretic security via symmetric entanglement, wherein a dual-layer private key structure supports zero-knowledge proofs even over adversarial or compromised channels. This construction ensures that no partial disclosure or observation of the communication reveals knowledge about the witness, due to the tightly coupled, non-factorable entanglement of symbol layers within the morphic space.

## üîê  Symmetric Holographic Morphism ( Entangled Proof of Knowledge )

The Rosario-Wang architecture presents a novel zero-knowledge proof system based on *holographic morphism* and dual-layer private keying, designed to ensure *information-theoretic security* even over compromised channels. The system models information as projections within a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, encoding a private sequence $P = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\} \subset A$, where $A$ is a static alphabet, through dynamically shuffled challenge spaces. Each authentication round $R$ uses a shuffling function $\Sigma: A \rightarrow X^R$, generating a distinct challenge alphabet $X^R$, thereby preventing repetition and enabling non-determinism.

Security derives from a dual-layer private key structure. The first layer comprises a cognitive-symbolic commitment: the sequence $P$ exists only in the prover‚Äôs memory and is never transmitted. The second layer consists of a projection morphism $\mathcal{M}: P \mapsto \Pi(X^R)$, which embeds the sequence into a round-specific morphic space. Crucially, the two layers are independently non-invertible‚Äîwithout access to $P$, the projection appears statistically random, and without $\mathcal{M}$, the sequence lacks semantic context. This design enforces entanglement in the cryptographic sense: partial knowledge of either layer yields no meaningful leakage.

The core primitive of this architecture is the *holographic morphism* $\mathcal{H}$, defined as a modality-preserving bijection between distinct representational layers:

$$
\mathcal{H}: \mathcal{L}_i \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_j \quad \text{such that} \quad \forall \ell_i \in \mathcal{L}_i, \; \exists \ell_j = f(\ell_i, \theta),
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_i, \mathcal{L}_j$ represent separate encoding spaces (e.g., letters, colors, spatial orientations), $\theta$ is a private transformation parameter, and $f$ is a non-linear, structure-preserving function. This mechanism introduces symbolic entanglement: recovery of a partial component (e.g., a color) provides no advantage without the correct coupling to its corresponding elements. Formally, the probability of reconstructing the full state from an intercepted partial morphism satisfies

$$
\Pr[\text{recover full state} \mid \text{partial view}] \approx \frac{1}{|\mathcal{L}_i|^k},
$$

where $k \geq 3$ in typical implementations involving triple entanglement across symbol, color, and rotation spaces.

To validate the prover's knowledge, the system employs an accumulator $\Lambda$ that aggregates individual verification results across $n$ rounds:

$$
\Lambda = \bigwedge_{R=1}^n M(p_i, x_i^R),
$$

where $M(p_i, x_i^R)$ denotes whether symbol $p_i$ maps to the expected subset $x_i^R \subset X^R$ under the morphism. A probabilistic variant models uncertainty or noise in the challenge-response channel:

$$
\Lambda_{\text{new}} = \prod_{R=1}^n \Pr(M(p_i, x_i^R) = \text{true} \mid x_i^R, R).
$$

This construction supports zero-knowledge operation: no verifier or adversary ever observes the witness $P$ or projection key $\mathcal{M}$, only the result of the verifier function over public challenge alphabets $X^R$.

The projection function $\Pi$ maps the sequence $P$ into a foliated submanifold $\mathcal{M}_X \subset \mathcal{H}$, such that any external observer can at most view a low-dimensional "slice" of the projection space. This design ensures semantic indistinguishability and prevents reverse engineering of the morphism.

Rosario-Wang system provides a zero-knowledge authentication protocol that is both quantum-resistant and secure under passive interception. The key insight lies in treating symbol spaces as entangled morphisms within a higher-dimensional encoding framework‚Äîeach authentication round behaves as a non-repeating projection into a different facet of a morphic lattice, tightly binding cognitive and mathematical primitives. This makes the protocol suitable for secure identity verification, cognitive ZKPs, and cryptographic applications requiring modality-agnostic commitments.

### 1. **Hilbert Space Projections**

Let $\mathcal{H}$ denote a separable Hilbert space. Information is encoded via manifold projections:

* A sequence $P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\} \subset A$, where $A$ is a static alphabet.
* A shuffling function $\Sigma \colon A \rightarrow X^R$ generates a unique round-dependent alphabet $X^R$.

### 2. **Two-Layer Private Key Structure**

* **Layer 1**: Cognitive-symbolic commitment, a witness sequence $P$ that exists only in the prover‚Äôs memory.
* **Layer 2**: A projection morphism $\mathcal{M} \colon P \mapsto \Pi(X^R)$, a dynamic, language-subset embedding.

Each layer is non-derivable from the other:

* Without $P$, the projection morphism appears random.
* Without $\mathcal{M}$, the sequence $P$ lacks operational context.

This dual secrecy layer reflects **entanglement**‚Äîalteration or observation of one layer collapses the entire verification ability.

### 3. **Holographic Morphism (‚Ñã)**

Defined as:

$$
\mathcal{H} : \mathcal{L}_i \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_j \text{ such that } \forall \ell_i \in \mathcal{L}_i, \exists \ell_j \in \mathcal{L}_j \text{ where } \ell_j = f(\ell_i, \theta)
$$

Where:

* $\mathcal{L}_i, \mathcal{L}_j$ are distinct alphabets or modalities (e.g., color, orientation, gesture),
* $\theta$ is a private, non-repeating transformation key.
* $f$ is a manifold-preserving bijection.

This yields **perfect security** under symmetric entanglement: guessing any one component (e.g., a color) gives no advantage without its entangled counterparts (e.g., orientation and symbol), due to:

$$
\Pr[\text{recover full state} \mid \text{partial morphism observed}] \approx \frac{1}{|\mathcal{L}_i|^k}
$$

with $k$ ‚â• 3 for triple-entanglement (e.g., symbol-color-rotation).

## üõ° Security Guarantees Over Compromised Channels

The security of the Rosario-Wang proof is retained via:

### a. **Zero-Knowledge Witnessing**

The proof $\Lambda$ is an accumulation:

$$
\Lambda = \bigwedge_{R=1}^n M(p_i, x_i^R)
$$

with probabilistic version:

$$
\Lambda_{\text{new}} = \prod_{R=1}^n \Pr(M(p_i, x_i^R) = \text{true} \mid x_i^R, R)
$$

No private component $P$ is transmitted. An attacker intercepts only the public morphism challenge $X^R$ and does not learn $P$ or $\mathcal{M}$.

### b. **Indistinguishability via Manifold Foliation**

The projection:

$$
\Pi : P \mapsto \text{foliated manifold } \mathcal{M}_X \subset \mathcal{H}
$$

ensures that the observer sees only one "slice" of a high-dimensional morphic surface‚Äîinsufficient to invert or learn private mappings.

### üß† Key Insight

The system‚Äôs **holographic morphism** acts like a private, non-invertible lens: a non-linear, multidimensional encoding function that entangles symbolic content across multiple modalities. Together with a dual-layer private key architecture and zero-knowledge accumulation, it offers **quantum-resistant, interception-safe authentication** even across compromised channels.

   A PRP is a bijective private map; knowing the key lets you run the inverse permutation instantly, while outsiders only see an apparently random shuffle of the space.

   FSS splits a keyed function $F\_K$ into additive ‚Äúshares‚Äô‚Äô such that each server holds an apparently random map; only by combining outputs do you recover F\_K(x). It is a distributed, key-split form of private map ideal for rate-limited or threshold settings. ([tzin.bgu.ac.il][12])
