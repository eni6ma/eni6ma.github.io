**Why it sticks:** A single, human-usable proof becomes the trust root for every SKU—delivering a password-free, tamper-proof fabric that stretches from a mobile login to a sovereign ledger audit without retraining users or re-architecting stacks.

### **Unified Product-Market Mix**

ENI6MA’s **PASS+ Freemium** (Universal SSO \+ 5 GB Audit) on-ramps users.  
 From there, verticalised bundles land where trust gaps are existential:

| Tier | Includes | Target / Channel |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Governance Suite** ($7 user/mo) | BallotGuard \+ NonRepudiate Signer | Civic-tech vendors, proxy-voting firms |
| **Privacy Shield** ($9 user/mo) | Private-ID Vault \+ ZKP Core | HIPAA cloud vendors, fintechs via MSSP |
| **Trace Pack** ($0.02 event) | Provenance Ledger \+ Ownership Validator API | Supply-chain ISVs, NFT platforms |
| **Sovereign Licence** (site) | All modules \+ on-prem consensus cluster | National ID agencies, central banks |

**Channel Play:**

**Why It Wins:** a **single cognitive credential** unlocks every SKU—making ENI6MA the first password-free trust fabric you can deploy from polling booth to shipping dock without re-training the user.
