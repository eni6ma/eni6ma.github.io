Biometric logins and traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) both depend on data that can be stolen and on hardware that can break. A fingerprint, face scan, or one-time code must travel over a network or sit on a device. If that data leaks, it is compromised for life, your face cannot be re-issued. Phones run out of battery, tokens get lost, and hardware cameras can be spoofed with photos or gummy prints. Attackers can still intercept or replay codes in transit, and every stored biometric hash or shared secret drags an organisation into heavy GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI audit scope. Even the cryptography behind today’s MFA will need replacing when practical quantum computers arrive.

ENI6MA’s PASS PLUS avoids every one of those weaknesses. No secret ever leaves the user’s mind, so there is nothing to steal, replay, or store. If a mnemonic is exposed, the user simply chooses a new one, no lifetime damage. It runs on any screen or even on paper card grids, works offline, and never ties a person’s identity to a fragile device. The one-time challenge is generated with quantum-grade randomness, so a recorded session is useless the next time, and the protocol’s information-theoretic design is already safe against future quantum attacks.

The experience is different too. Setup is a one-off: a user invents a short colour-shape story, their private mnemonic map. At login they see a shuffled grid of symbols, tap or speak the public colours that match their private map, and they are in. It feels like solving a quick puzzle instead of filling a form. Lose the phone, switch devices, or sit in an offline kiosk and the same mental ritual still works, no reset emails, no help-desk call, no waiting on an SMS that may never arrive. Because nothing personal leaves the brain, no site can track a user across services, and auditors find no credentials at rest. In short, biometrics and MFA secure the perimeter with fragile, irrevocable data; ENI6MA secures identity at its source, inside the user’s head, while making sign-in faster and friendlier for everyone.
